## The building blocks

### Tech stack

  - Language: **Kotlin** (v1.4+)
  - Environment: **JVM** (best with `JDK 11`)
  - Framework: **Spring Boot** (v2)
  - Storage: **PostgreSQL & H2** (as base)
  - Build System: **Gradle** (v6.7+)
  - CI: **GitHub** Actions
  - Delivery: **Docker** with Compose

This project follows the most common practices for the tech stack chosen.

## Building and testing the project

To build and test, run the following (from the project's root directory):

```bash
./gradlew build
```

To only build (without tests), run:

```bash
./gradlew assemble
```

To only run quality checks and test (this might build), run:

```bash
./gradlew check
```

To run Kotlin lint checks locally, the recommended way is to install the **KtLint plugin** from your IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences > Plugins. KtLint configuration is in `.editorconfig`.
KtLint can be run using Gradle:

```bash
./gradlew ktlintCheck
```
